		<div class="popover-content">
			Elo rating is calculated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Theory" target="_blank">standard way</a>:
			<ul>
				<li>400 points difference means 90% chance for winning</li>
				<li>Start rating is 1500 points</li>
				<li>Minimum is 10 matches</li>
			</ul>
			However, highly customized <strong>K-factor</strong> function reflecting tournament level, match round and player current rating is used:
			<ul>
				<li>K factor base value is 100</li>
				<li>Tournament level adjustment is: Grand Slam 100%, Tour Finals 90%, Masters 80%, Olympics 75%, ATP 500 70% and all others 60%</li>
				<li>Match round adjustment is: Final 100%, Semi-Final 95%, Quarter-Final 90%, Round of 16 85%, Round of 32 80%, Round of 64 75%, Round of 128 70%, Round-Robin 90% and For Bronze Medal 97.5%</li>
				<li>Number of sets adjustment: Best-of-5 100% and Best-of-3 90%</li>
				<li>Walk-over adjustment: 50%</li>
				<li>Current rating adjustment (this allows lower ranked players to advance more rapidly, while stabilizes ratings at the top):
					<ul>
						<li>For rating of 1800 and below: 100%</li>
						<li>For rating between 1800 and 2000: linear scale between 100% and 50% (i.e. for 1900: 75%)</li>
						<li>For rating of 2000 and above: 50%</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Surface factor (for Elo ratings by surface only): Hard 175%, Clay 185%, Grass 240%, Carpet 290%</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Start rating is 1500</strong> for new players joining ATP circuit, while for players at the beginning of Open Era start rating is the average Elo rating for the current rank.<br/>
			<strong>Average Elo rating</strong> of Top 10/20/50/100/200 as calculated by this formula is guaranteed to be constant over time, even at the beginning of Open Era,
			thus it is a relatively good indication of comparable player strengths across Eras.<br/>
			<strong>Not playing penalty</strong> - In original Elo, there is no penalty when player are not playing for longer periods of time.
			However, after they start playing matches again, the Elo rating obviously does not reflect their current form. To address this, non-playing Elo rating penalty is introduced.
			Penalty starts after player does not play for 1 year, and increases linearly by 200 Elo rating points for each year of non-playing: not playing for 1 year: no penalty, 1.5 years: 100 points penalty, 2 years: 200, 3 years: 400, etc.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Examples</strong> (upsets make bigger points exchange):
			<ul>
				<li>Grand Slam final, rating 2450 d. 2350 (0.36 - loser had 36% chances of win): 100 -> 0.36 * [+100 * 50%, -100 * 50%] = [+18, -18] (+18 for winner, -18 for loser)</li>
				<li>Masters semi-final ratings 2000 d. 2350 (0.81 - loser had 81% chances of win): 100 * 80% * 95% * 90% = 68.4 -> 0.88 * [+68.4 * 50%, -68.4 * 50%] = [+30.1, -30.1]</li>
				<li>ATP 250 round of 32, rating 2250 d. 1800 (0.07 - loser had 7% chances of win): 100 * 60% * 80% * 90% = 43.2 -> 0.07 * [+43.2 * 50%, -43.2] = [+1.5, -3.0]</li>
			</ul>
