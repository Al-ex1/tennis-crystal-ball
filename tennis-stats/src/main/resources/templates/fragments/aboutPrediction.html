		<div class="popover-content">
			Match Prediction is based on the Neural Network Algorithm with ~50 neurons for different features about players like Elo Rating, Surface Elo Rating, ATP Points,
			Head-to-Head ratios and Winning Percentages varied by surface, tournament level, tournament, round, recency, match or set ratios, vs rank, vs hand, vs backhand...<br/>
			Neural Network is trained on historical data for highest prediction rates to determine optimal feature weights.<br/>
			Elo Ratings, overall and by surface, are main contributors to the match prediction, following by H2H percentages, recent form and vs hand (vs left-hander or vs right-hander).
