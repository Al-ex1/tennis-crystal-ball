	<h4 class="text-nowrap">Tennis Data</h4>
	<p>
		Data on which the statistics is based is from open source tennis data repository by <a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann">Jeff Sackmann</a>, with some corrections and additions where data is wrong or lacking.
		Even with these corrections and additions, there are still small errors and data missing.
		Most notably for all tournaments between 1969 and 1972, as well as full rankings between 1981 and 1983.
		Rankings before official ATP rankings from 1973 are estimated and as well still not complete.
		Please provide feedback on data as well at mcekovic@gmail.com or <a href="https://github.com/mcekovic/tennis-crystal-ball/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	<h4 class="text-nowrap">'GOAT' Formula</h4>
	<p>
		A lot of content on this site is based on 'GOAT' formula, which is a formula to quantify tennis player achievements throughout their careers and to compare players from different eras.
		'GOAT' formula is based on assigning 'GOAT' points to players for tournament results, rankings and various important achievements.
