stats.opponentRank.title=Average opponent rank (geometric mean)
event.participation.title=Participation percentage measures how much the best players participate in the draw (100% if all top players participate in the draw). Formula: sum(ParticipationWeight(rank)) / sum(ParticipationWeight(1..PlayerCount)): i.e. sum of participation weights of all players in the draw compared to maximal participation weight if all top players would have been participated, where participation weight depend on ranking (see Participation Weights in the About page).
event.strength.title=Tournament strength measures how hard is to win a tournament based on weighted Elo ratings of the participating players. Formula: sum(ParticipationWeight(EloSeeding) * (Elo - 1500) / 400) * BestOfFactor, i.e. weighted sum of participating players strengths based on Elo Rating multiplied by best-of factor: 1.25 for Grand Slam, 1 for other tournaments (better player has 25% more chances to win in best-of-5 compared to best-of-3), where weight depend on Elo-based seeding (see Participation Weights in the About page)
event.averageEloRating.title=Average Elo rating measures average strength of the participating players. Formula: sum(ParticipationWeight(EloSeeding) * EloRating) / sum(ParticipationWeight(1..PlayerCount)), i.e. weighted average of participating players Elo ratings at the beginning of the tournament, where weight depend on Elo-based seeding (see Participation Weights in the About page)
event.participation.weights=Participation weights: Weights of players participating in the tournament based on their ranking or seeding (depends on context): [1: 100, 2: 85, 3: 75, 4: 67, 5: 60, 6: 55, 7-8: 50, 9-10: 45, 11-13: 40, 14-16: 35, 17-20: 30, 21-25: 25, 26-30: 20, 31-35: 16, 36-40: 13, 41-45: 10, 46-50: 8, 51-60: 6, 61-70: 5, 71-80: 4, 81-100: 3, 101-150: 2, 151-200: 1]
event.titleDifficulty=Factor of difficulty to win the title compared to a difficulty for an average title winner to win an average tournament event of the same tournament level (first, probabilities to win the title for an average title winner of the same tournament level are calculated based on average Elo Rating of the title winners as well as Elo Ratings of the opponents actual winner has faced (P = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ ((AvgWinnerElo - ActualOpponentElo) / 400)); second, difficulty to win the title is calculated as the sum of inverse probabilities from the first step; third, title difficulty is normalized so that average difficulty of the same tournament level is 1)
